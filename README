Video capture and archiving program.

Runtime requirements:

 - Linux kernel 2.6 or higher
 - Video4linux2 compatible capture devices (the older Linux 2.4-ish video4linux interface is not supported)
 - 1GHz processor or faster, dual core recommended
 - 256MB of RAM or higher
 - X-Windows (XFree86 or X.org) with SHM and Xv extension libraries
 - GTK+ 2.23 or higher
 - Glib, pango, freetype

Also recommended:

 - X-Windows installion with stable drivers and YUV overlay support
 - 800x600 or higher display
 - Plenty of hard disk space



As of 2011/11/30 some keyboard shortcuts have been implemented to assist in using the program:
 
   Left/Right Arrow Keys ................. Single-step through the AVI
   Spacebar .............................. Toggle between Play/Pause or begin playback
   Escape ................................ Stop playback
   ',' and '.' keys ...................... Slow down/Speed up and possibly reverse playback.
                                           These keys also have < and > markings on them.
   1, 2, 3, and 4 ........................ Switch to input 1, 2, 3, or 4
   Shift+I ............................... Switch to IP input
   Shift+F ............................... Switch to File input
   Ctrl+O ................................ Select capture file for File input

What is currently implemented:
 - video capture, live feed display, and recording to an AVI file when recording activated
 - loading/saving configuration (videocap.ini)
 - IP input configuration dialog
 - Client-server communication
 - The use of the X-Windows SHM extension (shared memory segment bitmap transfer)
 - The use of the X-Windows XVideo extension to enable use of the hardware YUV overlay
     typically present on modern VGA graphics chipsets.
 - Scrubbing through the captured file

Yet to do:
 - IP input decoding and display (MPEG transport stream). TS code is in place, not yet
   fully functional.
 - File -> Convert menu command. I understand one of the things to implement was a
     "convert to other format" option.
 - IP input metadata reception and decoding (partially written, not yet stable and complete).
