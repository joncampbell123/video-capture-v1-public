This README explains each patch:


saa7134-video-dont-reset-tvnorm.patch 

  - As described in NOTES, the saa7134 driver resets the TV norm
    and therefore the crop rectangle every time the video or vbi
    device is opened, even if from another process.

    This patch is a quick fix to resolve that, though probably
    not a long-term solution.
